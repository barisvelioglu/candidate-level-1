# Candidate Task 1: Microservice Communication Optimization

## **Overview**
Our system consists of dozens of microservices, each responsible for specific tasks and currently communicating using **HTTP-based APIs**. While this approach is simple and widely adopted, it may introduce performance bottlenecks, especially as our system scales. Latency, additional overhead, and challenges with reliability and scalability are potential limitations of the current implementation.

Your task is to evaluate the current **HTTP-based communication approach**, identify its weaknesses, and research alternative communication methods or protocols that could better meet our performance, scalability, and reliability needs. 

---

## **Key Expectations**
1. **Current Approach Analysis**: 
   - Strengths: Simplicity, widespread understanding, and compatibility with existing tools and frameworks.
   - Weaknesses: Potential latency issues due to repeated connections and handshakes, overhead from headers, and the synchronous nature that might not handle traffic spikes efficiently. Reliability mechanisms like retries and error handling may require custom implementation.

2. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Research and explore alternative communication approaches or protocols.
   - Compare the benefits and trade-offs of these alternatives.
   - Consider aspects like reduced latency, improved performance, scalability for high-traffic environments, and reliability features like automatic retries or better fault tolerance.

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on your analysis, propose a solution that you believe best addresses the identified challenges.
   - Justify why this solution is most suitable for our needs in terms of performance, scalability, and reliability.

4. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Provide a high-level plan to implement the recommended solution.
   - Identify necessary changes to the current services and a strategy for transitioning without disrupting the system.
   - Highlight potential risks, such as compatibility issues, complexity of adoption, or team learning curve, and propose mitigation strategies.

## **Process**
1. You have **15 minutes** to:
   - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the current approach.
   - Research and identify alternative communication methods.
   - Evaluate and compare the alternatives, focusing on performance, scalability, and reliability.

2. Present your findings and recommendation in a **10-minute discussion**:
   - Summarize the challenges with the current approach.
   - Present alternative options with their benefits and trade-offs.
   - Recommend the most suitable solution and provide a high-level implementation plan with risk mitigation.

Feel free to ask clarifying questions at any point during the process.
