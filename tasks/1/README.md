# Candidate Task 1

Our system consists of dozens of microservices, some of which communicate via HTTP-based APIs. However, we want to improve the performance of inter-service communication.

Your task is to analyze the current approach, identify potential bottlenecks, and research alternative solutions that could address these challenges. After evaluating the alternatives, propose your recommended solution and explain why itâ€™s the most suitable for our needs.

**Key Expectations:**
1. Compare the benefits and trade-offs of the alternatives you discover.
2. Focus your analysis on improving performance, scalability, and reliability.
3. Include a high-level implementation plan and highlight potential risks.

**Process:**
- You have **15 minutes** to research and gather information.
- Afterward, you will present your findings and recommendation in a **5-minute discussion.**

Feel free to ask clarifying questions during the process.
